## Description
The Weather App is a React-based web application that allows users to search for cities and view the current weather conditions as well as the daily forecast for the upcoming days. The app utilizes two main APIs: the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and the GeoDB Cities API from RapidAPI to provide autocomplete suggestions for city names.
